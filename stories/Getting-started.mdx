## Install

`@tsed/react-formio` can be used on the server, or bundled for the client using an
npm-compatible packaging system such as [Vite](https://vite.dev/), [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) or [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).


```sh
npm install @tsed/react-formio react-table --save
npm install formiojs choices.js --save // Install formiojs since it is a peerDependency
```


## Migrate to v2

If you use redux actions with v2, you have to install `@tsed/redux-formio-stores` and replace your imports:

```diff
- import { defaultFormioReducer, formsReducer } from "@tsed/react-formio";
+ import { defaultFormioReducer, formsReducer } from "@tsed/react-formio-stores";
```

## Migrate to v3

- `@tsed/react-formio` is now build only for ESM environment.
- `@tsed/react-formio` use tree-shaking to reduce the bundle size, you have to import only what you need from the library.
- `@tsed/react-formio` drop the support of TailwindCSS v2.

Example:

```diff
- import { Form } from "@tsed/react-formio";
+ import { Form } from "@tsed/react-formio/organisms/form/Form";
```

## Usage

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { FormBuilder } from "@tsed/react-formio/organisms/form/builder/FormBuilder";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className='App'>
      <FormBuilder display={"form"} components={[/**/]} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

<Canvas of={FormBuilderStories.WebForm}/>

## Registering react components

You can register your own components to be used within the `@tsed/react-formio` library. This is useful if you want to
customize `FormEdit` or `Table` components.

For example FormEdit component use the followings components:

```ts
import "@tsed/react-formio/atoms/icon/Icon";
import "@tsed/react-formio/molecules/button/Button";
import "@tsed/react-formio/molecules/forms/input-text/InputText";
import "@tsed/react-formio/molecules/forms/select/Select";
import "@tsed/react-formio/molecules/forms/select/components/HtmlSelect";
import "@tsed/react-formio/molecules/forms/input-tags/InputTags";
import "@tsed/react-formio/organisms/form/builder/FormParameters";
import "@tsed/react-formio/organisms/form/builder/FormBuilder";
import "@tsed/react-formio/organisms/form/builder/FormEditCtas";
```

You can replace for example replace the default React Button component provided by the library by your own Button:

```tsx
import {registerComponent} from "@tsed/react-formio/registries/components";
import type {ButtonProps} from "@tsed/react-formio/molecules/button/Button";

registerComponent("button", (props: ButtonProps) => {
  return <button {...props}>{props.label}</button>;
});
```
A large part of the provided component from the library can be replaced by your own component.

> Note: Override Button react component doesn't affect the button design and implementation used by formio.js.
> To styling the original button component formio, you have to redefine the `.btn` class in your CSS.
