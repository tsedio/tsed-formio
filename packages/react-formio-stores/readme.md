<hr />

A [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) library for rendering out forms based on the [Form.io](https://www.form.io)
platform.

This module is based on the original [react-formio](https://github.com/formio/react-formio) and add extra features
listed above.

See our [storybook](https://formio.tsed.dev/) to see all available components.

## Install

`@tsed/react-formio-stores` can be used on the server, or bundled for the client using an
npm-compatible packaging system such as [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) or
[webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).

```bash
npm install @tsed/react-formio @tsed/react-formio-stores react-table --save
npm install formiojs @formio/choices.js --save // Install formiojs since it is a peerDependency
```

## Usage

`@tsed/react-formio-stores` contain Redux actions, reducers and selectors to simplify the API requests made for `form.io` forms.
reducers, actions and selectors.
The following reducers have names:

- formsReducers: manage the forms,
- formReducers: manage the current form,
- submissionsReducers: manage the submissions of a form.
- submissionReducers: manage the current submission of a form

This provides namespaces so the same actions and reducers can be re-used within the same redux state.

In addition, the package provides the follwing reducers

- actionsReducers: Manage actions of a form.
- actionReducers: Manage the current action of a form.
- actionInfoReducers: Manage the available actions for all forms and resources.
- authReducers: Manage formio authentication.

By default, `@tsed/react-formio-stores` provides defaults combined reducers as following:

```typescript
export const defaultFormioReducer = combine(
  authReducer,
  actionsReducer,
  actionReducer,
  actionInfoReducer,
  formReducer("form"),
  formsReducer("forms", { query: { type: "form" } }),
  formReducer("resource"),
  formsReducer("resources", { query: { type: "resource" } }),
  submissionReducer("submission"),
  submissionsReducer("submissions")
);
```

This `defaultFormioReducer` can be added and configured in your rootReducer as following :

```typescript
import { combine } from "@tsed/redux-utils";
import { defaultFormioReducer, formsReducer } from "@tsed/react-formio-stores";
import { connectRouter } from "connected-react-router";
import { combineReducers } from "redux";

export const rootReducers = (history: any) =>
  combineReducers({
    router: connectRouter(history),
    ...defaultFormioReducer,
    // override defaultFormioReducer can done as following
    ...combine(
      formsReducer("forms", { query: { type: "form", tags: ["common"] } }), // return only forms with the common tags
      formsReducer("resources", { query: { type: "resource", tags: ["common"] } }) // return only resources with the common tags
    )
  });
```
