## Install

`@tsed/react-formio` can be used on the server, or bundled for the client using an
npm-compatible packaging system such as [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) or
[webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).

```bash
npm install @tsed/react-formio react-table --save
npm install formiojs choices.js --save // Install formiojs since it is a peerDependency
```

## Usage

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { FormBuilder } from "@tsed/react-formio";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className='App'>
      <FormBuilder display={"form"} components={[]} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Components

### Form

The form component is the primary component of the system. It is what takes the form definition (json) and renders the
form into html. There are multiple ways to send the form to the Form component. The two main ways are to pass the `src`
prop with a url to the form definition, usually a form.io server. The other is to pass the `form` prop with the json
definition and optionally a `url` prop with the location of the form.

#### Props

| Name         | Type   | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src`        | url    |         | The url of the form definition. This is commonly from a form.io server. When using src, the form will automatically submit the data to that url as well.                                                                                                                     |
| `url`        | url    |         | The url of the form definition. The form will not be loaded from this url and the submission will not be saved here either. This is used for file upload, oauth and other components or actions that need to know where the server is. Use this in connection with `form`    |
| `form`       | object |         | Instead of loading a form from the `src` url, you can preload the form definition and pass it in with the `form` prop. You should also set `url` if you are using any advanced components like file upload or oauth.                                                         |
| `submission` | object |         | Submission data to fill the form. You can either load a previous submission or create a submission with some pre-filled data. If you do not provide a submissions the form will initialize an empty submission using default values from the form.                           |
| `options`    | object |         | an options object that can pass options to the formio.js Form that is rendered. You can set options such as `readOnly`, `noAlerts` or `hide`. There are [many options to be found in the formio.js library](https://github.com/formio/formio.js/wiki/Form-Renderer#options). |

#### Event Props

You can respond to various events in the form. Simply pass in a prop with a function for one of these events.

| Name            | Parameters                                                                                                                                    | Description                                                                                                                      |

### FormBuilder

The [FormBuilder](https://formio.tsed.io/?path=/story/reactformio-formbuilder--sandbox)) class can be
used
to embed a form builder directly in your react application.
Please note that you'll need to include the CSS for the form builder from formio.js as well.

Please note that the [FormBuilder](<[FormsTable](https://formio.tsed.io/?path=/story/reactformio-formbuilder--sandbox)>)
component
does not load and save from/to a url. You must handle the form definition loading and saving yourself or use
the [FormEdit](https://formio.tsed.io/?path=/story/reactformio-formedit--sandbox) component.

#### Props

| Name      | Type   | Default | Description                                                                                                                                  |

#### Event Props

| Name                | Parameters          | Description                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `onChange`          | `schema`: object    | Triggered any time the form definition changes                   |
| `onEditComponent`   | `component`: object | Triggered when the component settings dialog is opened           |
| `onSaveComponent`   | `component`: object | Triggered when the component settings dialog is saved and closed |
| `onCancelComponent` | `component`: object | Triggered when the component settings dialog is cancelled        |
| `onDeleteComponent` | `component`: object | Triggered when a component is removed from the form              |
| `onUpdateComponent` | `component`: object | Triggered when a component is added or moved in the form         |

#### Example

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { FormBuilder } from "@tsed/react-formio";

ReactDOM.render(<FormBuilder form={{ display: "form" }} onChange={(schema) => console.log(schema)} />, document.getElementById("builder"));
```

### FormEdit

The [FormEdit](https://formio.tsed.io/?path=/story/reactformio-formedit--sandbox) component wraps
the [FormBuilder](<[FormsTable](https://formio.tsed.io/?path=/story/reactformio-formbuilder--sandbox)>) component and
adds the title, display, name and path fields at the top along with a save button.

#### Props

| Name                                                            | Type   | Default             | Description |

| ---------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `onSubmit` | form       | Called when the save button is pressed. Will pass the form definition to the callback. |

### FormsTable

The [FormsTable](https://formio.tsed.io/?path=/story/reactformio-formstable--sandbox) component can be used to render a
list of forms with buttons to edit, view, delete, etc on each row.

#### Props

| Name   | Type           | Default | Description                                 |
| ------ | -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `data` | array of forms | []      | A list of forms to be rendered in the grid. |

### SubmissionsTable

The submisison grid will render a list of submissions and allow clicking on one row to select it.

#### Props

| Name   | Type                 | Default | Description                                                                      |

## Redux

@tsed/react-formio contain Redux actions, reducers and selectors to simplify the API requests made for `form.io` forms.
reducers, actions and selectors.
The following reducers have names:

- formsReducers: manage the forms,
- formReducers: manage the current form,
- submissionsReducers: manage the submissions of a form.
- submissionReducers: manage the current submission of a form

This provides namespaces so the same actions and reducers can be re-used within the same redux state.

In addition, the package provides the follwing reducers

- actionsReducers: Manage actions of a form.
- actionReducers: Manage the current action of a form.
- actionInfoReducers: Manage the available actions for all forms and resources.
- authReducers: Manage formio authentication.

By default, `@tsed/react-formio` provides defaults combined reducers as following:

```typescript
export const defaultFormioReducer = combine(
  authReducer,
  actionsReducer,
  actionReducer,
  actionInfoReducer,
  formReducer("form"),
  formsReducer("forms", { query: { type: "form" } }),
  formReducer("resource"),
  formsReducer("resources", { query: { type: "resource" } }),
  submissionReducer("submission"),
  submissionsReducer("submissions")
);
```

This `defaultFormioReducer` can be added and configured in your rootReducer as following :

```typescript
import { combine } from "@tsed/redux-utils";
import { defaultFormioReducer, formsReducer } from "@tsed/react-formio";
import { connectRouter } from "connected-react-router";
import { combineReducers } from "redux";

export const rootReducers = (history: any) =>
  combineReducers({
    router: connectRouter(history),
    ...defaultFormioReducer,
    // override defaultFormioReducer can done as following
    ...combine(
      formsReducer("forms", { query: { type: "form", tags: ["common"] } }), // return only forms with the common tags
      formsReducer("resources", { query: { type: "resource", tags: ["common"] } }) // return only resources with the common tags
    )
  });
```
